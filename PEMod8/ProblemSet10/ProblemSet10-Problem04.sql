-- ## Problem 4
-- 
-- Create a procedure named prc_cus_balance_update that will take the invoice number 
-- as a parameter and update the customer balance.
-- 
-- Hint: You can use DECLARE to define a TOTINV numeric variable that holds the computed 
-- invoice total.
-- 
-- Check your prodecure code by calling it with an invoice number and then verifying that 
-- the data in the CUSTOMER table are updated apprporiately.  You will need to use your
-- prc_inv_amounts procedure to make sure things work correctly!
-- 
-- Make sure you include the appropriate DELIMITER statements in your solution!
